# Client Task B #
# Add your pseudocode to this file below this line: #
# ------------------------------------------------- #

We would have to layout the warehouse into a grid with key locations listed like entrance, exit, shipping, receiving, office, packing and so on. 

Once the key locations are listed we can allow the user to move in the 4 set directions. 

We can let the user select the area they want to get to and then direct them there from their current location.

Examples of the steps could include an array of the warehouse, implementing user logic to show where they are  where they want to go and a loop to allow for continuous movements of the user.
