# Client Task A #
# Add your pseudocode to this file below this line: #
# ------------------------------------------------- #

First the computer picks a random number from 1-10

The player  wouled get 3 tries to guess the number

If the player gets it right they win but if they get it wrong they loose a chance. 

This would continue until the player gets it right or runs out of chances

This game would use if statements for if the number is correct and if not decrease the amount of tries left

It also would use variables for a random number generator, how mnay chances the player has left and to keep track of how many guesses they have left

Conditionals would be used to see if the guess is right.

I feel this game could be programmed even better with Python and maybe some of my (imaginary) colleagues with experience with Python could help too!
